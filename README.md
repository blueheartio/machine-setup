# machine-setup
A script to set up your Mac, for new starters

Before you start, a note on development machines / OS. We're a React Native app, so you'll want a Mac machine. It's possible to do some dev work on Linux but you'll need a Mac anyway to build the iOS app. Don't try to to use a Windows machine, even with WSL (there are so many problems you'll run into that it's not even worth listing them).

Once you've gotten your Mac set up with the latest version of OSX and the latest version of XCode[1], follow the script called [bootstrap-mac.sh](/bootstrap-mac.sh)

[1] it's possible that a different version is needed, but the latest is a good place to start and we always aim to support it
