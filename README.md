# machine-setup
A script to set up your Mac, for new starters

Before you start, a note on development machines / OS. We're a React Native app, so you'll want a Mac machine. It's possible to do dev work on Linux but you'll need a Mac anyway to build the iOS app. On Windows you'll run into a few problems (even with WSL) so we don't support it for now.

Once you've gotten your Mac set up with the latest version of OSX and the latest version of XCode, follow the script called [bootstrap-mac.sh](/bootstrap-mac.sh)
